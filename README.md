# School District Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to uphold state-testing standards after the school board learned about reading and math academic dishonesty at Thomas High School. To do this, we will replace the Thomas High School math and reading scores with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once that's been done, we'll discuss how these changes have affected the overall analysis. 

## Results

### How the District Summary is Affected
Although minor, there were some subtle differences between the previous data, and the now altered data that correponds with there being some academic dishonesty when it comes to the district summary. The imagine below shows a comparison between the district summary before (first chart), and the district summary after (second chart) the Thomas High School math and reading scores were replaced with NaNs. When rounded, there is about a 1% difference between the Percentage Passing Math, Reading and Overall Passing but everything else remains about the same.
